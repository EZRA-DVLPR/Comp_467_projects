# Comp_467_projects

This will hold all the projects and lessons for my comp 467 class.
The better/projects I like more will be referenced via my personal website at: https://ezra-dvlpr.github.io/personal_website/

## About this repo

This repo will contain only code in python that I submitted for grade in my Comp 467 class at CSUN.
The 

## Projects

1) Import txt files and parse through retrieving the filepath that exists in both as well as frames that correspond to the matching path
2) Import txt files and parse through retrieving parts of data from the files and filenames themselves to add to either a DB or a CSV file
3) Import txt files and parse through retrieving information from the files as well as the filenames. Connects to DB to extract thumbnails from given video, outputs XLS, and uploads thumbnails to Frame.io if the new XLS output is selected. All previous projects also function as expected

## Lessons

1) 20 random numbers in an array
2) Read a file and output the file's contents with all vowels replaced with '9'
3) Every second check for a new file within the directory titled 'week3' that exists within the directory containing all the lessons. Once a new file is found display info about the file and current time.
4) Removes space from improper filenames and indicates those that needed correcting and those that did not
5) Mongo DB Database Tutorial. See -- https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_mongodb_getstarted.asp -- Get Started, Create Database, Create Collections, Insert and print to consoe the output from all 4 sections
6) Argparse script with verbose option that displays each line from file. Always displays total lines from end of file.
7) Script that takes a frame and turns it into a working timecode at 24 fps. Eg. to be used are 35, 1569, 14000. Also takes a single user input!
8) calls 'ls -l' command on a folder and reutnrs the file with the largest file size as well as its name.
9) Imports a video file and will change resolution of given video strem. Also changes the audio stream to be echoed. Outputs these altered streams into a single new video in an alternate format (webm) instead of the the given (mp4)
